    <content type="text"><![CDATA[PSILOCYBIN==============Does psilocybin worth investing? Today one article on the economist caught my interest. Basically the article said the psilocybin, the magic mushrooms, could save normal people and patients with depression and pressure. It seems that the psilocybin have good potential on medical usage. Though it was banned in US after 1970, the trend, with the opinion towards marijuana, is changing. In my opinion, I think rehabilitate will be more and more important in future. “300m people worldwide suffer from depression, according to the who; 8m people die from tobacco addiction every year.” The current study shows that magic mushroom is more safer than even tobacco. The biggest blocker I think now is legal issue. There are few companies who are working on developing psilocybin. “Compass is undertaking the first large-scale trial of the safety, efficacy and appropriate dosage of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression.” Other interesting resource I found: psilocybin technology WUHN]]></content>
